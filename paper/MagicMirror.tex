\begin{abstract}
This semesters IoT project was building a “Magic Mirror”. 
A Magic Mirror is a piece of 1 way glass with a computer monitor behind it to display a set of dynamic information such as the news, weather, or personal calendar events in the presence of person in front of it.
\end{abstract}


\section{Introduction}
%A brief introduction to the background, motivation of the work, challenges of performing the work, contributions of the work and the structure of the rest of the paper. Novelty of the work should be emphasized in the section of introduction.
A Magic Mirror is a Raspberry Pi powered computer display that sits behind a sheet of one way mirror glass as shown in Figure \ref{fig:mirror}.
The Mirror is designed to detect the presence of person and activate the display when a person is detected.
Displayed on the screen are various dynamic items which the user may find helpful when looking in the mirror such as the current weather and time.

\section{Related Work}  
%An academic paper should demonstrate novelties, i.e., things and/or theories that have not been done in the whole world. This requires the authors to be familiar with the complete bibliography. The most related work to this paper should be presented in this section. Comparison should be made whenever necessary to demonstrate the difference between this work and related work.
%REMEMBER TO CITE!!!!


%%% Harun, you need to find the original project that this is based on and cite it.
%%% also talk about how our project differs from that original project.



\section{System} 
%The name of this section can be the name of the actual system students are developing or other meaningful names. A detailed description of the system. The overall design of the system should be presented first, followed by detailed introduction to complicated components. Subsections should be used whenever necessary, for example, when the content is too long as one section/subsection.
Building the Magic Mirror consisted of two parts, building the device, and writing an inituitve web interface.
\subsection{Building the Magic Mirror}
The mirror that was constructed for this project was assembled using a variety of used electronics as shown in Table \ref{tab:cost}.

\subsection{Programming the Magic Mirror}

\section{Analysis} 
%In the section of System, we focus on the big picture of the system and cover most issues that can be explained clearly. We often move heavy mathematical analysis of components and performance of the system into another section called Analysis or other appropriate names. 

\section{Evaluation}
%In this section, system performance is presented. How well does the system achieve its goal? Quantitative metrics should be used whenever necessary. Tables, figures with curves and charts are often used to show the performance such as the trend. To this end, 
  %whatever system students have developing, at least one week of data must be collected to show meaningful results. 
%For the alternative project on Edimax plug security, students should use Raspberry Pi to control the plug for at least one week and record the activities of turning on/off the plug with Raspberry Pi and other meaningful data.


%%% Peter, include the results of your data here with graph or table.
%%% examples of how to do this are shown below
%%% also talk about your results and what they mean




% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% Note that the IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.

%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
